# Footer Implementation Plan for BanglaDoctor

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Step 1: Read a sample other page (e.g., patient-auth.html) to confirm footer structure and ensure consistency across pages. (No footer found; will add new one.)
- [x] Step 2: Update footer HTML in index.html to match the design (three columns: Contact Us with LinkedIn/email/phone, Quick Links with About Us/Terms & Conditions, Subscribe form; add copyright).
- [x] Step 3: Update assets/css/style.css with new footer styles (orange background, column layouts, form styling, responsiveness).
- [x] Step 4: Propagate footer updates to other main pages (patient-auth.html, doctor-registration.html, patient-dashboard.html, doctor-dashboard.html, confirmation.html).
- [ ] Step 5: Test the implementation by starting a local server and using browser_action to view index.html, verify layout, and check responsiveness.
- [ ] Step 6: If needed, add basic JS for subscribe form handling in assets/js/main.js and re-test.

## Notes:
- Use Bootstrap grid for columns (col-md-4).
- Orange background: #FF6B35.
- Quick Links: Anchor to #about and #terms (create placeholders if needed).
- Subscribe: Static form for now; action="#" .
- Update this file after each completed step.
